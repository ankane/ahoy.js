# Ahoy.js

:fire: Visit and event tracking for JavaScript

- Easily track unique visitors
- Track events across page navigation

Use it with any backend.  For Rails, check out the [Ahoy gem](https://github.com/ankane/ahoy).

## Installation

Download [ahoy.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ankane/ahoy.js/master/ahoy.js) and include it after jQuery.

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="ahoy.js"></script>
```

## Custom Setup

Example of calling a remote API which is allowing the cross origin requests for this domain.

```html
<script src="jquery.js"></script>

<script>
    var ahoy = {
        visitsUrl: 'http://api.example.com/ahoy/visits',
        eventsUrl: 'http://api.example.com/ahoy/events',
        requestHeaders: {
            'Ahoy-Visit': '',
            'Ahoy-Visitor': ''
        }
    };
</script>

<script src="ahoy.js"></script>
```

## How It Works

When someone lands on your website, they are assigned a visit token and a visitor token.

The visit token expires after 4 hours, in which a new visit is created.  Visits are useful for tracking metrics like monthly active users.  The visitor token expires after 2 years.  A `POST` request is sent to `/ahoy/visits` with:

- visit_token
- visitor_token
- referrer
- landing_page

The server can capture:

- ip
- user_agent
- user - from app authentication

And calculate things like:

- referring_domain and search_keyword from referrer
- utm_source, utm_medium, utm_term, utm_content, and utm_campaign from landing_page
- city, region, and country from ip
- browser, os, and device_type from user_agent

## Events

Track events with:

```javascript
ahoy.track(name, properties);
```

A `POST` request is sent to `/ahoy/events` with:

- name
- properties
- time

The server can capture:

- visit_token - from cookies
- user - from app authentication

As a precaution, the server should reject times that do not match:

```
1 minute ago < time <= now
```

### All Events

Track all views and clicks with:

```javascript
ahoy.trackAll();
```

Set the page with:

```javascript
var ahoy = {
  page: "Landing page"
}
```

And sections with:

```html
<div data-section="Header">
  <a href="/home">Home</a>
</div>
```

These are included in event properties if set.

### Views

```javascript
ahoy.trackView();
```

Name - `$view`

Properties

- url - `https://www.streamflip.com`
- title - `Streamflip`

### Clicks

```javascript
ahoy.trackClicks();
````

Name - `$click`

Properties

- tag - `a`
- id - `account-link`
- class - `btn btn-primary`
- text - `View Account`
- href - `/account`

### Submits

```javascript
ahoy.trackSubmits();
````

Name - `$submit`

### Changes

```javascript
ahoy.trackChanges();
````

Name - `$change`

## Development

Ahoy is built with developers in mind.  You can run the following code in your browserâ€™s console.

Force a new visit

```javascript
ahoy.reset(); // then reload the page
```

Log messages

```javascript
ahoy.debug();
```

Turn off logging

```javascript
ahoy.debug(false);
```

## Reference

To track visits across multiple subdomains, add this **before** the javascript files.

```javascript
var ahoy = {"domain": "yourdomain.com"};
```

## TODO

- Send events in batches
- Add page and section for automatic events
- Add `trackContent` method
- Remove jQuery dependency
- Customize endpoints
